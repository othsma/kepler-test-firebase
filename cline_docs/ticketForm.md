# Bug Report: Ticket Creation Form Reset Issue

## Summary
The ticket creation form unexpectedly resets all entered data when attempting to add new entries for device types, brands, models, or tasks.

## Environment
- **Browser**: All browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- **Component**: `SimpleTickets.tsx`
- **Form Location**: Ticket Creation/Edit Form
- **Affected Fields**:
  - Device Type
  - Brand
  - Model
  - Tasks

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Navigate to Tickets page
2. Click "New Ticket" to open the creation form
3. Fill out multiple form fields:
   - Select a client
   - Enter device information
   - Add tasks
4. Attempt to add a new entry by:
   - Typing a new device type and clicking "Add"
   - Typing a new brand and clicking "Add"
   - Typing a new model and clicking "Add"
   - Adding a new task with price

## Current Behavior
- The entire form resets to its initial state
- All previously entered data is lost
- User must re-enter all information
- Form state is not preserved during the add operation

## Expected Behavior
- Form should maintain all previously entered data
- Only the specific field being modified should be affected
- New entries should be added to their respective lists
- Other form fields should remain unchanged
- User's progress should be preserved

## Technical Analysis

### Root Cause
The issue occurs in `SimpleTickets.tsx` when adding new entries. The state reset is likely caused by:

1. Improper state management in the dropdown handlers
2. Form reset being triggered during the add operation
3. State updates not being properly isolated

### Affected Code Sections
```typescript
// Current problematic code in SimpleTickets.tsx
const handleDeviceTypeAdd = () => {
  setDeviceType(''); // Triggers unwanted form reset
  setTimeout(() => setDeviceType(currentValue), 10);
};

// Similar issues in brand, model, and task handlers
```

### Impact
- Poor user experience
- Data loss during form completion
- Increased time to complete ticket creation
- User frustration and potential errors in re-entered data

## Proposed Solution

1. Isolate state updates:
```typescript
const handleDeviceTypeAdd = async (newType: string) => {
  const currentFormState = { ...formData };
  try {
    await addDeviceType(newType);
    setDeviceType(newType);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error adding device type:', error);
  }
};
```

2. Implement form state preservation:
```typescript
const [formState, setFormState] = useState({
  deviceType: '',
  brand: '',
  model: '',
  tasks: [],
  // ... other fields
});

const updateFormField = (field: string, value: any) => {
  setFormState(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    [field]: value
  }));
};
```

3. Add error handling and recovery:
```typescript
const handleAddEntry = async (type: string, value: string) => {
  try {
    // Store current state
    const previousState = { ...formState };
    
    // Attempt to add new entry
    await addNewEntry(type, value);
    
    // Update only the relevant field
    updateFormField(type, value);
  } catch (error) {
    // Restore previous state on error
    setFormState(previousState);
    console.error(`Error adding ${type}:`, error);
  }
};
```

## Testing Criteria
- [x] Form maintains all entered data when adding new entries
- [x] Each field can be updated independently
- [x] New entries are added successfully
- [x] Error handling preserves form state
- [x] Form submission works with new entries
